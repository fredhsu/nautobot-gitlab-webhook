## Tools Setup

### markdownlint-cli

Content is to be linted to ensure consistency of formatting. This requires using
[markdown-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli).

MacOS users can install markdownlint-cli via homebrew.

```shell
brew install markdownlint-cli
```

Alternately, markdownlint-cli can be installed via NPM, details are available at
the link above.

### pre-commit

In order to automate the process of linting a pre-commit hook is utilized. This
requires the installation of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com). Depending on
your environment, the installation process may vary.

#### python PIP installation

If you're using `pyenv` or some other python version manager, pre-commit can be
installed via pip. This ensures that it's installed to your preferred python
environment.

```shell
pip install pre-commit
```

#### homebrew installation

```shell
brew install pre-commit
```

## pre-commit setup

From the root of the repository execute `pre-commit install` this will add the
necessary hooks to your local git configuration and setup the necessary tooling
in order to suport development.

## mkdocs Operation

### installation

Install mkdocs via pip.

```shell
pip install mkdocs
```

### Theme Installation

```shell
pip install mkdocs-material
```

### Build Content

```shell
mkdocs build
```

### Locally (Re)View Changes

It is possible to see the locally rendered content and it is highly recommended that you validate that your changes do
not break something in the visual rendering of the site. In order to locally serve the site mkdocs will start a local
web server, this can be invoked via the following command.

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

## Site Deployment

The site should be built and generated from `main`. This will ensure that all of the content is integrated and
appropriately rendered. **DO NOT deploy directly from a branch other than `main`.** When there are changes to merge
generate a PR and have it merged into `main`. From main, issue a deployment using the mkdocs deploy function.

```shell
git pull --all      # make sure you have the latest version of main
git checkout main   # switch to the main branch (if necessary)
mkdocs build        # render the site
mkdocs gh-deploy    # deploy using the mkdocs tool
```
